Node.js Foundation - Node.js
=====

This repository is the working repository for the proposed convergence of the
https://github.com/nodejs/node and https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive projects under
the Node.js Foundation.

Contributions, releases, and contributorship are under the proposed
Governance and Developer Policy for the soon-to-be-launched Node.js
Foundation:

* https://github.com/joyent/nodejs-advisory-board/tree/master/governance-proposal
* https://github.com/nodejs/dev-policy

This project is operating with the oversight of the joint Node.js and io.js
core technical teams.

Note: The original io.js README.md is temporarily renamed to iojs_README.md.
